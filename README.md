## Mission
According to Electric Capital, There are around 26k active monthly developers as of June, 24. The main challenge for developers learning and contributing to Web3 is the limited availability of resources. There is a scarcity of good video resources, blogs and documentation around technologies powering web3. Easydwed aims to introduce open-source repos containing example implementations of code of different web3 technologies. It aims to provide the quickest way to build prototypes or projects for hackathons. 

<br />

## Guidelines
- Follow the structure of the repo
- Code needs to be clear and commented
- Try to keep it simple
- Include an entry in contributions.md along with your PR
- Mail me at anshsaxena4190@gmail.com for suggestions
